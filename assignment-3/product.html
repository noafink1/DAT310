                            <p>The MacBook Pro 16-inch (2022) is one of the best laptops creative professionals can buy, thanks to its brilliant performance, stunning screen and long battery life. However, it is large and heavy, which is why the 14-inch MacBook Pro may be a better buy, unless you want the larger screen and longer battery life.</p>
                            <p>It doesn’t get any more premium than the MacBook Pro 16-inch (2021). This flagship portable, which was released in October of 2021 along with its smaller counterpart, the MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021), has pushed the boundaries of what you can expect out of a professional laptop. It not only overhauls the design of 2019’s 16-inch MacBook Pro, but also adds in some great new features and an impressive amount of performance.</p>
                            <p>The performance of the Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch (2021) is incredibly similar to that of the slightly more portable MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021), thanks to the fact that they sport basically the same hardware, with the new M1 Pro or M1 Max chips available for both models. The main difference is mostly due to its size since you’ll get a bigger screen and higher resolution, not to mention longer battery life.</p>
                            <p>So, if you’re looking for something portable, we recommend reading our comprehensive MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021) review as that might be a better fit. Otherwise, if you care about longevity and screen real estate, the MacBook Pro 16-inch (2021) is the laptop for you.</p>
